# Stack programming language standard
- Separate tokens with line breaks, spaces, or tabs
- When a value appears as a literal, type it and put it on the stack
- When a variable name appears, put the value of the variable on the stack
- Variables are used for medium- to long-term data storage separately from the stack
- Strings enclosed in sharps `#` are recognized as comments.
- Execute as a command if literal cannot be recognized as a value
- Command arguments must be taken from the stack, and return values must be placed on the stack.
- Arguments taken from the stack undergo implicit type conversion when executing the command.
- If not recognized as a command, put it on the stack as a string
- Value data types are numeric, logical, string, and list.
- Enclose strings in half-width round brackets `( )` to allow nesting.
- Enclose the list in half-width parentheses `[ ]` to enable nesting.
- Evaluate the expression in the literal without delimiting the list, and use the increase in the stack as an element of the list
