#  Standards of Stack Programming Language
- Separate tokens with line breaks, spaces, or tabs.
- When a value recognized as a literal, typecasting it and push it on the stack.
- When a variable name appears, push the value of the variable on the stack.
- Variables are used for medium to long term data storage separately from the stack.
- Strings enclosed in sharps `#` are recognized as comments.
- Execute as a command if literal cannot be recognized as a value.
- Command arguments must be taken from the stack, and return values must be push on the stack.
- If command execution get any error, push the error value on the stack.
- Arguments taken from the stack undergo implicit type conversion when executing the command.
- If not recognized as a command, push it on the stack as a string.
- Primitive data types are number, logical, string, list, and special type is error.
- User can define original object by instantiation from list type data structure. 
- Enclose string in half-width round brackets `( )` , it can nesting.
- Enclose list in half-width parentheses `[ ]` , it can nesting.
- Evaluate the expression in the literal in the list, and use the increase in the stack as an element of the list.
