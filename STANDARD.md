#  Standard of Stack Programming Language
- Separate tokens with line breaks, spaces, or tabs.
- When a value recognized as a literal, type it and push it on the stack.
- When a variable name appears, put the value of the variable on the stack.
- Variables are used for medium to long term data storage separately from the stack.
- Strings enclosed in sharps `#` are recognized as comments.
- Execute as a command if literal cannot be recognized as a value.
- Command arguments must be taken from the stack, and return values must be placed on the stack.
- Arguments taken from the stack undergo implicit type conversion when executing the command.
- If not recognized as a command, put it on the stack as a string.
- Value data types are only numeric, logical, string, and list.
- Enclose string in half-width round brackets `( )` , it can nesting.
- Enclose list in half-width parentheses `[ ]` , it can nesting.
- Evaluate the expression in the literal in the list, and use the increase in the stack as an element of the list.
